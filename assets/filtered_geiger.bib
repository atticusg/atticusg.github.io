  abstract = 	 {How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real improvements? In pursuit of lasting evaluation standards, we propose MIB, a Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark, with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models. MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal pathways or causal variables in neural language models. The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components—and connections between them—most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAE) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and align those features to a task-relevant causal variable. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method performs best, while SAEs features are not better than neurons, i.e., non-featurized hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB enables meaningful comparisons, and increases our confidence that there has been real progress in the field.}

    abstract = "Sentiment is a pervasive feature in natural language text, yet it is an open question how sentiment is represented within Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study, we reveal that across a range of models, sentiment is represented linearly: a single direction in activation space mostly captures the feature across a range of tasks with one extreme for positive and the other for negative. In a causal analysis, we isolate this direction using interventions and show it is causal in both toy tasks and real world datasets such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank. We analyze the mechanisms that involve this direction and discover a phenomenon which we term the summarization motif: sentiment is not just represented on valenced words, but is also summarized at intermediate positions without inherent sentiment, such as punctuation and names. We show that in SST classification, ablating the sentiment direction across all tokens results in a drop in accuracy from 100{\%} to 62{\%} (vs. 50{\%} random baseline), while ablating the summarized sentiment direction at comma positions alone produces close to half this result (reducing accuracy to 82{\%})."
